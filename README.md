# Network Meta-analysis

## What is a network meta-analysis ?

Netowrk meta-analysis is advanced method of meta-analysis that can incorporate several interventions and compare them (directliy and inderectly) simultaneously ([Dias et al. 2013](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0272989X12458724?rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed&url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org)). 
> In a summary, data from randomized controlled trials can be combined (A vs. B, A vs. C, B vs. D, etc.) to deliver an internally consistent set of estimates while respecting the randomization in the evidence.

In this initial tutorial I present the code necessary to conduct a Network meta-analysis in R with available dataset. For further information a recommend the book [Doing Meta-Analysis with R: A Hands-on Guide](https://bookdown.org/MathiasHarrer/Doing_Meta_Analysis_in_R/) by Mathias Harrer et al.
